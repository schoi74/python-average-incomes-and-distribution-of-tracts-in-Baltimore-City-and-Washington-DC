# Average Incomes and Distribution of Tracts in Baltimore City and Washington D.C.

## Background
On April 25, 2015, Emily Badger published an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/29/the-long-painful-and-repetitive-history-of-how-baltimore-became-baltimore/) on _The Washington Post_ about the long, painful, and repetitive history of how Baltimore became Baltimore. She says that there exists an irony where the history of Baltimore City has become something that "deminished the capacity of low-income urban black communities to recover from the one that came next" and how the "fundamental urban inequality [is] created over the years by active decisions and government policies that have undermined the same people and sapped them of their ability to rebuild, that have again and again dismantled the same communities, each time making them socially, economically, and politically weaker". 

Then about four years later, on March 20, 2019, Sarah Meehan published an [article](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-gentrification-study-20190319-story.html) on the _Baltimore Sun_ about how Baltimore is "among seven U.S. cities that accounted for nearly half the country's gentrification between 2000 and 2013". However, a majority of the neighborhoods that were gentrified in Baltimore from 2000 and 2013 were dominantly white. While the white community in Baltimore, specifically around Inner Harbor or areas south and east of downtown Baltimore, experienced gentrification and its benefits, "'there were a very limited amount of black displacement just because black neighborhoods weren't gentrified'". Following these two articles, does the fact that people have stayed in the same tract or commuting zone have an effect on people's incomes? Does staying in the same tract in Baltimore and Washington D.C. differ from those who have moved around? We will delve more into the data provided by [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) to further analyze the social mobility metrics in both Baltimore City and Washington D.C..

## Data Question - Open Data
We will use open data from one source:

* Opportunity Atalas: this research group constructs ["publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population".](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-opportunity-atlas/) 

  i. Original open data on household income for families in Baltimore City and Washington D.C.
  ii. Original open data on household income for families who have stayed in the same commuting zone in Baltimore City and Washington D.C.
  
## Data Answer - Visualizations
